# 30-Projects-AI

This repository contains a collection of 30 AI projects that range from fundamental concepts to real-world applications. Each project is designed to help you understand and implement various AI techniques and algorithms using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Projects

1. **Image Classifier using Keras and TensorFlow**: A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the MNIST dataset.
2. **Simple Chatbot using predefined responses**: Implements a basic chatbot that uses predefined responses to interact with users. This project demonstrates how to create a simple rule-based chatbot without the need for machine learning models. The chatbot can handle a limited set of queries and provide appropriate responses based on predefined rules.
3. **Spam Email Detector using sklearn with Kaggle dataset**: Focuses on building a spam email detection system using the `sklearn` library and a dataset from Kaggle. This project involves preprocessing the email data, extracting features, and training a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. The notebook covers various steps such as data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
4. **Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones**:
